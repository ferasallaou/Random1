Playing with UIView.Animate &amp; IBInspectable 


# What I've learned

* I read this article https://nshipster.com/ibinspectable-ibdesignable/ about IBInspectable which allows the user to control some properties from the Inspector.
Corner radius is an example of an option which cannot be controlled using the inspector in Storyboard, thus extending UIView or UILable to add this option using @IBInspectable will solve the issue.

* Also, I've created a game which allows the user to move the brick with in the view & this to demonstarte what I've learned from this article
